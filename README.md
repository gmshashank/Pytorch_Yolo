# Pytorch_Yolo
YOLO algorithm implementation in Pytorch

This repository contains code for a object detector based on [YOLOv3: An Incremental Improvement](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/papers/YOLOv3.pdf), implementedin PyTorch. The code is based on the official code of [YOLO v3](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet), as well as a PyTorch 
port of the original code, by [marvis](https://github.com/marvis/pytorch-yolo2). One of the goals of this code is to improve
upon the original port by removing redundant parts of the code


# Getting started

To be able to follow the project, you are going to need a laptop with Miniconda (a minimal version of Anaconda) and several Python packages installed.
The following instruction would work as is for Mac or Ubuntu Linux users, Windows users would need to install and work in the [Git BASH](https://gitforwindows.org/) terminal.


## Download and install Miniconda

Please go to the [Anaconda website](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).
Download and install *the latest* Miniconda version for *Python* 3.7 for your operating system.

```bash
wget <http:// link to miniconda>
sh <miniconda*.sh>
```


## Create isolated Miniconda environment

Change directory (`cd`) into the course folder, then type:

```bash
# cd folder_name
conda env create -f environment.yml
source activate dl_vision
```


## Detection Example

## Running the detector

### On single or multiple images

Clone, and `cd` into the repo directory. The first thing you need to do is to get the weights file
This time around, for v3, authors has supplied a weightsfile only for COCO [here](https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights), and place 

the weights file into your repo directory. Or, you could just type (if you're on Linux)

```bash
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights 
python detect.py --images imgs --det det 
```

`--images` flag defines the directory to load images from, or a single image file (it will figure it out), and `--det` is the directory
to save images to. Other setting such as batch size (using `--bs` flag) , object threshold confidence can be tweaked with flags that can be looked up with.
